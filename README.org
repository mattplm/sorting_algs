#+TITLE: Visualisation of sorting algorithms

In this repository, there are implementations for a number of common
sorting algorithm and a mean to visualize them. The implementations
mostly come from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm][this]] Wikipedia page.

Matplotlib is used as the frontend of the program but could be easily
swapped with any other frontend.

The program is not intended to serve any purpose but to allow me to
look back at it when needed. You may use it for any purpose in
accordance with the license.

* Inspirations

Of course this mini project was inspired by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg][this]] youtube video. Also
the bubble sort visualization from [[https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/114-bubble-sort.html][the coding train]].
